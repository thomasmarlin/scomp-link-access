# Scomp Link Access 
Welcome to the Star Wars CCG Card Search website! This repository contains all of the UI for searching and displaying all of the existing SWCCG cards.

For more information about Star Wars CCG, check out the SWCCG Players Committee website here: https://www.starwarsccg.org/


# Where Does Your Data Come From?
The card data comes from the SWCCG-Card-JSON Database here (https://github.com/swccgpc/swccg-card-json/)


# Where Are The Images?
All of the images are hosted in the Holotable Git repository (https://github.com/swccgpc/holotable). This database links directly to those images.

# How Can I Run This Locally?
The website code is flexible enough to run on pretty much any web server.  The easiest way to run this locally is to use Python's SimpleHTTPServer.  It's extremely easy to install. Simply follow the steps here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

After you've followed those instructions:
1) Open a command prompt
2) Navigate to the folder containing this code
3) Type  "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
4) Open any browser to "localhost:8000/index.html"

Done!  You should be able to play around with the site locally now.
